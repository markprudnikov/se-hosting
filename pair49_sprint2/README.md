hosted at http://clabsql.clamv.jacobs-university.de/~apronichev/

## Fixes
* Separated code to different files
* Corrected `WorldCell` class according to spec
* Fixed cell offset in map drawing

## Progress
* Added most of the classes
* Added subpajes and transitions to html page
* Added file uploading with upload validation
* Added partial validation of map file (nest integrity validation still missing)


## Next steps
* Implement `Assembler` (translation of bug assembly code to list of instructions)
* Implement `Tournament` (main game logic: on every tick for each bug get next instruction, execute it, update bug state)
